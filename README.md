# SMART-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Smart Management System incorporates Arduino-based hardware functionalities alongside a mobile application developed using MIT App Inventor. This system aims to streamline task management in a smart and interactive way.

Overview:

This project combines a web-based management platform with hardware components controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino manages physical components while the MIT App Inventor mobile app provides a user-friendly interface for remote control and monitoring.

Hardware Components:

a)Arduino Mega2560

b)Ultrasonic sensor,SR-04

c)Bluetooth module,HC-05

d)LED

e)Resistor

Installation & Usage:

a)Upload the Arduino_code to your Arduino board (The arduino code is provided)

b)Install the MIT App Inventor APK on your Android device (The design app is provided)

c)Open the MIT App Inventor project and connect it to your Arduino board
